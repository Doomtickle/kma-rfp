#KMA Media Purchasing portal 

This program needs to do the following:

1. Allow users to create an account and log in (Done)
2. Assign a role of admin of admin or user (Done)
3. Admins should be able to create a Proposal Request
4. Proposal Request link would be emailed to specific users
5. Users would then log in and submit a proposal form and upload any extra files
   5a. Proposals should belong to the specific user that submitted it
6. Admins should be notified by email when a user submits a proposal
7. Admins can log in and view the Proposals that belong to a specific Proposal request
8. Users should be notified by email whether their proposal was accepted or rejected by an admin.

Notes:
1. I've got most of the forms built, but I'm having trouble bringing it all together.
2. Don't worry about styles or CSS.  I can handle that once functionality is complete.
3. I've uploaded examples spreadsheets of the complete Proposal Request Form and the forms we need the user to fill out. You can view them at the following links:
    Proposal Request: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2bUMpqlvRr-RDJkUzFjNnF0OTg
    Proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jjZM8DKqs-lrBtkk6erSW_aXTec4Eksvx_G7Xx_WBb4/edit?usp=sharing 

4. We don't need the following, followers, or microposts sections.  I just copied that from the ruby tutorial online.  We can take those out.  

5. This is also already on heroku at  https://rfp.kerigan.com
    Once negotiated, I can give you access so that you can push directly to heroku.
